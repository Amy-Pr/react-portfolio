<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>My final project for completion of the React learning track from Treehouse. I updated and adapted my previous HTML/CSS portfolio into a React application to showcase my current skills. Each section of the site is its own component for easy updates. Individual projects are contained in an array of objects and looped over. Also a handy hamburger menu was added for mobile version.</p>

<h1>Tools Used</h1>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Javascript/JSX</li>
<li>React</li>
</ul>
